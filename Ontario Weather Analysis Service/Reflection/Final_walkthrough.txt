WALKTHROUGH

59) Starting point of the program's execution. (program execution begins here)

62) An object, named album, of a struct Album type is initialized with 4 members. 

67) An int type array named artistIDs of size 3 is initialized with 3 values (146, 731, 269). 
Where, (size = MAX_ITEMS) and (MAX_ITEMS = 3)

69) An int type variable, named time, is declared and initialized to store the return value of searchSongs function.
Thus a call is made to the searchSongs function and 2 arguments are passed through it, from which, 
1st is album (passed by address) and 2nd is artistIDs (passed by value).

45) Program enters searchSongs function from here with 2 parameters named album and artists.

47) Declaration of i as integer without initial value and duration as integer with initial value 0 (duration=0).

49) Output:- Album: JAZZ5

51) for loop, i is set to 0; condition (0<3). True : Enter Loop

53) duration is initialized to store the return value of searchArtists function.
Thus a call is made to the searchArtists function and 2 arguments are passed through it, from which, 
1st is album->songs[0] (176, 269, "JA52", 621)  (passed by address) and 2nd is artists (passed by value).

27) Program enters searchArtists function from here with 2 parameters named song and artists.

29) Declaration of i as integer without initial value and duration as integer with initial value 0 (duration=0).

31) for loop, i is set to 0; condition !duration && (0<3). True : Enter Loop

33) if condition, (269 == 146). False 

31) Value of i is increamented by 1, for loop, i=1; !duration && (1<3). True : Enter Loop 

33) if condition, (269 == 731). False 

31) Value of i is increamented by 1, for loop, i=2; !duration && (2<3). True : Enter Loop 

33) if condition, (269 == 269). True : Enter 

35) A call is made to the displayDuration function and 1 arguments are passed through it,
named song->durationSec

22) Program enters displayDuration function from here with 1 parameters named duration.

24) Output:- 10 21 (without moving to next line)

36) Output:- -> 176 269 JA52

38) duration = 621

42) return value 621 to duration variable in searchSongs function.

51)  Value of i is increamented by 1, for loop, i=1; (1<3). True : Enter Loop 

53) duration is initialized to store the return value of searchArtists function + duration. 
duration = 621 + searchArtists(&album->songs[i], artists)
Thus a call is made to the searchArtists function and 2 arguments are passed through it, from which, 
1st is album->songs[1] (285, 734, "JA54", 362)  (passed by address) and 2nd is artists (passed by value).

27) Program enters searchArtists function from here with 2 parameters named song and artists.

29) Declaration of i as integer without initial value and duration as integer with initial value 0 (duration=0).

31) for loop, i is set to 0; condition !duration && (0<3). True : Enter Loop

33) if condition, (734 == 146). False 

31) Value of i is increamented by 1, for loop, i=1; !duration && (1<3). True : Enter Loop 

33) if condition, (734 == 731). False 

31) Value of i is increamented by 1, for loop, i=2; !duration && (2<3). True : Enter Loop 

33) if condition, (734 == 269). False 

31) Value of i is increamented by 1, for loop, i=3; !duration && (3<3). False : Exit Loop

42) return value 0 to duration variable in searchSongs function.

51) Value of i is increamented by 1, for loop, i=2; (2<3). True : Enter Loop 

53) duration is initialized to store the return value of searchArtists function + duration. 
duration = 621 + searchArtists(&album->songs[i], artists)
Thus a call is made to the searchArtists function and 2 arguments are passed through it, from which, 
1st is album->songs[2] (789, 146, "JA56", 278)  (passed by address) and 2nd is artists (passed by value).

27) Program enters searchArtists function from here with 2 parameters named song and artists.

29) Declaration of i as integer without initial value and duration as integer with initial value 0 (duration=0).

31) for loop, i is set to 0; condition !duration && (0<3). True : Enter Loop

33) if condition, (146 == 146). True : Enter

35) A call is made to the displayDuration function and 1 arguments are passed through it,
named song->durationSec

22) Program enters displayDuration function from here with 1 parameters named duration.

24) Output:- 04 38 (without moving to next line)

36) Output:- -> 789 146 JA56

38) duration = 278

42) return value 210 to duration variable in searchSongs function.

53) duration = 621 + 278 = 899

51) Value of i is increamented by 1, for loop, i=3; (3<3). False : Exit Loop

56) return value 899 to time variable in main function.

69) time = 899

71) Output:- Total Time: (without moving to next line)

72)  A call is made to the displayDuration function and 1 arguments are passed through it,
named time

22) Program enters displayDuration function from here with 1 parameters named duration.

24) Output:- 14 59 (without moving to next line)

74) returns control back to CPU.
