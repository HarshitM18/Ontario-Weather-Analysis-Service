Answers:

a.1) Yes, I was working in a group and the work was very evenly distributed among each of us. Despite of the fact that someone knew coding or not, someone was a free or not etc each work was equally and adequately distributed among us. 
So that none of us is overburdened with work or neither one of us feels that he/she is being exploited. We also made sure that if one of the group member is facing any issue or has a doubt that he is not being able to solve, we help him in solving it.
In order to begin with assigning tasks and distributing work, we hosted a meeting and in that we went through and discussed the complete program, including its complete working, logic and how it is expected to produce the overall solution.
Then, we broke down the complete program into 5 parts, in which each of the 4 parts comprised of 3-4 functions depending upon the logic applied. And the 5th part that was, the overall functioning of program, that included some helper functions and functions like menuMain that bounded the complete program.
As we were 3 members in total, we evenly distributed 3 of the 5 parts among each other and rest, the left out parts, that included 4th part was done in a group work whereas the 5th part (helper functions and overall functions) was done by me alone.
To elaborate, each of the 4 parts (comprised of 3-4 functions each) included a function named view (for example, viewAllData, viewByRegion, ViewByMonth, viewByLocation). Another function similar in all parts was a display function (for example, displayAllData, displayRegionData, displayMonthData, displayLocationData).
The third function similar to all was displayDataHeader function and the last function everyone had in common was a sort function. Thus, we divided 3 parts among us and among the 2 left out parts one was done by me alone and the other was done in group work by hosting group meetings.

a.2) I believe that like each one of my group members, I had an equal contribution towards our solution and the work assigned to me was of similar importance as assigned to everyone else. Me and my team members divided our work into parts and and each member was assigned a single part. 
Each such parts had multiple functions that were needed to be created by the person individually to whom it was assigned.                                                                                                                                                           

(i) Thus if I Firstly, talk about the functions solely created by me, were the functions that were assigned to me in my individual part. There were also helper functions and overall functions that were created by me solely.                                                                        
There were three functions in total, required to be created by me individually in my assigned part (from 3 divided parts), that comprised of displayDataHeader, displayAllData and viewAllData. The 5th parts also required me to create individual functions which comprised of helper and overall functions. 
The helper functions that were made by me were clear Buffer Input, input Int, input Range and suspend. I also made the menu Main function all by my own that was one of the major functions of the solution that was responsible for binding the overall solutions. 
Now, there were also some functions that did not code alone but I helped and contributed in the creation off. These were, all the functions in part 4, namely, viewByLocation, displayDataHeader and displayLocationData.

(ii) I truly believe that my contribution was 40-45 % towards the overall solution. This is majorly because some functions that were created by me, not only contributed to a small portion of the a major function but also had relevance with the overall functionality of the program.                                                                          
Elaborately, menuMain was one such functions that was solely created by me and that function was the function that called all of our four major view functions that further called on to display functions (sub functions) that represented data.                                                                                                        
Also, all the helper functions, made to assist in the smooth and better functioning of program, were made by me alone. In addition to creating some of the major logic functions, I also did the complete coding for my part which showed and verified the complete data that was imported from text file.                                 

3) As this application development was centered around the data manipulation thus the creation of data structure was really necessary to simplify the solution and organize information in an efficient way. Hence, a lot of data structures were required to be created and used by me.

a. Thus the data structures used by me for my part in this application were, namely, FinalWeather, LocationData, WeatherRecord, Location and Date.

b. Structures were introduced into programming in order to reduce the complexities faced in coding your logic and thus, I truly believe that use of structure in code doesn't have any disadvantage. But instead, it attributes numerous advantages towards solution.
To begin with, data structure named FinalWeather was created so that it can store all other major structures within it. The benefit of this would be that by passing just one structure we can get access to all the structures declared within the application. 
Another data structure named LocationData was created to store particularly the name of the location and the precipitation amount at that location. This is a sub-structure of FinalWeather structure and was created to be particularly used for functions related with viewByLocation function and this was also its biggest advantage.
A data structure named WeatherRecord was created to store all the details or data that is imported from a textfile into the program. Its advantage was that, as it contained the complete weather data, it was used and accessed by each of the other data structures to obtain data. 
The two data structures named, Location and Date were created by me to be used as sub-structures of WeatherRecord structure. The benifits of creating these structures was that these could be accessed individually as well as from the structure WeatherRecord, hence offered a great flexibility.

4) The most difficult/challenging part of logic coded by me was creation of the overall functionality of the program which included binding all the functions of the program to one another.
The difficulty in this was, that it was really hard to link every function to one another and it required the creations of a major functions along with creation of some helper functions. 
Thus in order to overcome this challenge, I created a data structure named FinalWeather that contained all the other structures within itself and hence,
by the help of it, I created a function that called all other sub-functions in it by passing FinalWeather as a parameter. Hence creation of a main function, a main data structure and some helper functions,
helped in overcoming difficulties and challenges faced by me.
